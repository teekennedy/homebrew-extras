# Teekennedy Extras

Repo for syncing my customized formulae across devices. Feel free to use, but don't expect much in the form of support.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install teekennedy/extras/<formula>`

Or `brew tap teekennedy/extras` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
