# Teekennedy Extras

Repo for syncing my customized formulae across devices.
Feel free to use, but don't expect support as these are temporary.

## Godot 4.0 RC1

Prerelease version of Godot based on the official cask. No checksum, and livecheck support is broken.

Install: `brew install --cask teekennedy/extras/godot`

## OrcaSlicer 2.1.0-beta

Prerelease version of OrcaSlicer that has reduced purge support ported from bambuslicer. Couldn't wait for it to be released as stable.

Added a checksum for arm.

Install: `brew install --cask teekennedy/extras/orcaslicer`
